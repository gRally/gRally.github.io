Hi all,
this is a small post to inform you about the status of **gRally**.

Many people ask to become beta tester.. well, unfortunately is not yet the moment, 'cause we need more time to make **gRally** usable in your pc, but we're not far from this point :)

In the past months we made great things about the details of the stage `Baitoni Bondone`, improving the shaders and the lights to allow the best yield to the great work due by the 3d artists.

Another thing is to test the new [Ogre 2.1](http://www.ogre3d.org) as graphics rendering engine, with  64 bits compiled, DirectX 11 and the [PBS shaders](https://www.allegorithmic.com/pbr-guide).
At the moment the things to do are infinite, but the first attempt is a great start point!
