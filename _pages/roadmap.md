## Near term
The `Near term` stuff are things that we're working on or we plan to do shortly
{: .notice--success}

### Ryggesbro
<div id="container90" class="gRally-progress"></div>
A new gravel stage set in a swedish forest :evergreen_tree: built whith the [Moose](https://holymooses.com/PRL/blog.php) procedural stage creator.

### Controllers configuration
<div id="container85" class="gRally-progress"></div>
This is a tricky stuff: we've completely rewrote the input management to make gRally more versatile to
every controller the user has;
Unfortunately this thing took us more time than expected: but we're on the right way to fix definitively
the controller issues.

### Codriver Improvements
<div id="container80" class="gRally-progress"></div>
We work on a improved codriver `AI` that follow better the speed and the driving style of the driver, avoiding to call the notes lately and in a wrong time.

### New Engine physics
<div id="container75" class="gRally-progress"></div>
With the latest [gCarEditor](https://github.com/gRally/gCarEditor) release we started to code the Turbo and 4x4.. we're working to make it 'definitive'



## Mid term
The `Mid term` stuff are things that we're plan to do but not immediately
{: .notice--warning}

### Dynamic tyres
<div id="container70" class="gRally-progress"></div>
This is a cool thing: with this feature the 3d tyre and texturizing is done automatically: the user will be
able to choose a different rim, different rim color, different caliper color and the core do everything.
Finally we'll have a different tyre shape when we choose the tyre for the stage.
The modder are also able to make a custom rim for the model _(for example if the car should have a particular
rim)_.

### Rain
<div id="container65" class="gRally-progress"></div>
In the pre-steam release we worked on the rain feature, but we preferred to release it when is 100% done, 
with the aquaplanning and different damp/wet zones.

### GH-40
<div id="container55" class="gRally-progress"></div>
We're working on a completely new car, inspired _(as usual)_ to 70's great rally car revisited to the
new era shape: this car will be 4wd with a turbo engine, to let the people to play with the new engine physics.

### UI for VR
<div id="container30" class="gRally-progress"></div>
At the moment gRally is shipped with a working VR management, but the VR is basic.
In this step with the VR you can interact with the UI

### Baitoni-Bondone
<div id="container25" class="gRally-progress"></div>
Our first stage, now in refactoring mode after some big changes on the physics engine and trees engine.

### Unity 2018
<div id="container20" class="gRally-progress"></div>
We want to be aligned with the Unity releases and this step should improve the framerate and the graphics.

### FMOD
<div id="container15" class="gRally-progress"></div>
We'll use [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com/) to manage all the sounds in game, this will be a great step for the
car modders, to create great audio behaviour especially for the car engine.



## Long term
The `Long term` stuff are things that we wish do but we don't know when
{: .notice--danger}

### Live rally championship
<div id="container10" class="gRally-progress"></div>
The main goal of gRally is the online rallies and championships, to recreate the incredible fun of the
WIRC rally championships on the past years: to complete this great milestone the way is long: we need
more cars and stages and some live test rallies to make the server stuff unbreakable.
