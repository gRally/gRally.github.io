**Hi all!**
Let's try this new sharing adventure... sometimes the development of gRally seems to be quiet 
but this is not true.. the fact is that sometimes the new issues or changes require more time and we stay 
silent but still alive!

In this place we want to share the future features, the bug fixing history and some useful informations 
to the modders and to the drivers.

Here is a thing you will see in the next releases...

we created the dynamic tyres: this will take many advantages:
 - the modders have less things to do _(four things... üòÅ)_;
 - the user can customize the rims: can choose from a library and can change the colors;
 - finally we'll have different 3d tyres from different tyre type
