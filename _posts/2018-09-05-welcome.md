Hello everyone

You are wondering why this blog .. not the first time I try _(in vain)_ to have,  but above all, to manage a space like this.

What's different about this time? Well, first of all, now [gRally](https://grally.net) came out so I can talk freely about what I'm doing, whereas before it was always difficult to find arguments _(I'm not a good advisor...)_ on something not still existing, now they are certainly not few.

The idea of this space came to me thinking of the first months of [gRally](https://grally.net), where, we are trying to solve all _(as much as possible)_ problems related to peripheral configurations, crashes, etc ... and this, especially for those who have everything working, I understand that it can be unnerving, because, after more than [10](https://changelog.grally.net) releases from the output, apparently not nothing has changed.

I want to share with you the difficulties, the satisfactions, the moments of madness, the dreams that have and are accompanying me in the nights dedicated to the development of [gRally](https://grally.net).

enjoy the reading!
