Hello everyone

Are you are wondering why this blog?

It's not the first time I try _(in vain)_ to have,  but above all, to manage a space like this.

What's different about this time? Well, first of all, now [gRally](https://grally.net) came out so I can talk freely about what I'm doing, whereas before it was always difficult to find arguments _(I'm not a good advisor...)_ on something not still existing, now they are certainly not few.

Second, the idea of this blog came to me thinking to the first months of [gRally](https://grally.net) after the early-access release where we dedicated a lot of time solving _(as much as possible)_ problems related to crashes, peripheral configurations and so on. Due to this hotfixing phase, I felt that the perspective from a "all is working" user is that gRally has nothing new but this is not really true.

(QUESTO L'ORIGINALE)
Second, the idea of this space came to me thinking of the first months of [gRally](https://grally.net), where, we are trying to solve all _(as much as possible)_ problems related to peripheral configurations, crashes, etc ... and this, especially for those who have everything working, I understand that it can be unnerving, because, after more than [10](https://changelog.grally.net) releases from the output, apparently not nothing has changed.

Third, I want to share with you the difficulties, the satisfaction, the moments of madness, the dreams that I have and they are accompanying me in the nights dedicated to the development of [gRally](https://grally.net).

Enjoy the reading!
