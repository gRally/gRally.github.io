Hello everyone!!!

Last time you read something about us, we were celebrating our first birthday of gRally as public release and some months passed with no news after that.
Our silence is not because we're on hold, quite the opposite.
We're focused on a feature that is actually one of the first pillars that inspires us to start with this project.
Probably someone has already foreseen what we're referring, the others should patience a bit, when we'll be ready we'll surely announce to everyone.

To support this feature we're producing additional graphic contents that will improve our visual appeal and give more "life" to our special stages.

Following a slideshow with a preview of what we're doing.
