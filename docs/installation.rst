First Steps
===========

Welcome aboard! when you launch **gRally.exe** the ``Drive`` page
appears, but before you drive, you need to configure some things:

    ‚ö†Ô∏è All the settings are saved automatically, so you only need to
    change the setting!

Video/Display
-------------

The first and simple configuration is to change the video resolution:
click the config button on the top bar

|video settings|

Into this page you need to set the right resolution and the fullscreen.

The other pages/settings are explained later.

Pacenotes

Into this page you can customize the Codriver AI, but the first thing
that you should do is select the codriver, mostly for the non italian
people üòÅ

Controls

This is one of the biggest changes of this menu:

Analogic controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To set your analog control you just need to click the radio button on
the left of the interested control *(ie: ``steering wheel``)* and move
the axis, so you can see a graph that show how will work the control in
**gRally**

You can set the maximum and minimum value for each control clicking the
button on the left/right of the slide *(in the shot the clutch has the
maximum about at 75%, the green line)*

You can change the linearity of the control moving the slider below the
graph

You can invert/no invert the control with the toggle button.

Goofy controls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The analogic and digital controls are now unified: this means that for
the analog controls like steering, accelerate, handbrake, etc. it's
possible use an analogic controller or a digital controller.

The big difference is for the steering, that when you use an analogic
wheel you use one input, and if you use a digital controller you need to
configure a left and right buttons.

Digital controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To set the digital controls you do the same thing like the analogic
controls.. you can click a joystick button or a keyboard key, once is
set, clicking the element, the icon become red.

Here is the table of the default settings:

+-------------+-------+
