Hi guys,
welcome back with a new development post.
It's May, and near the end of this month gRally will have its second birthday.
A birthday it's an important day for everyone and for gRally it's not different so we'll show you something that we hope you'll appreciate.

We're really happy and excited to finally share with you what we're cooking by one year but, before go deeper with details, please, let me recap a bit the background of our choices for everyone that haven't read the post we published one year ago.

When we started thinking about gRally, one of the first target of the project was to try to catch the spirit of rally racing and, for us, one of the more fascinating thing is the talent to drive a car, with the help of a navigator, on a semi-unknown road path trying to be the fastest.
Discussing about this we faced immediately the difficulty to recreate the same real rally situation mainly due to these:

- we're a very small team and we'll not be able to prepare a huge amount of stages in a very short time to support different rallies
- following the first point, thinking to release few stages and try to combine them in some rally championships will give an advantage to the simdriver that will have time to memorize the stage path

It looked like we were in a dead loop but, as we're not so remissive, we continued to study a solution and finally we're ready to release our INFINITE system.

## **What's INFINITE?**

INFINITE is our system to create stages procedurally.
This will give us the opportunity to create several stages with unique layouts. You'll never find a layout that it's the same of another one.
Due to this, we'll be able to create several rally and championships and we can offer you the opportunity to race against the other with the same starting chances: just your driving talent and attention to the navigator notes. 
We're very eager to see you race on the next Live rally we're preparing.

## **Qualche screenshots per gli ambienti**

## **Just INFINITE? No!**

We haven't just develop INIFINITE during the last months but we worked hard to improve the overall experience.

We know that gRally is not perfect and there are some small but important aspects that need polishing and fixing so, in the last months , we fixed some bugs and added some featues.
Improvements concerns the controls configuration management, the Live rally and the Roadbook interface, the rendering performance.
About the control configuration management we added a load/save option so you could customized file for every different peripheral you want to use with gRally. For example now you can switch from keyboard to wheel loading a "keyboard" configuration file that you saved previously.

Live rally and the Roadbook interface needed a little refreshing because the previous layout was missing some stage information and it was not so clear. Now we think that it's better for everyone to understand what's going on the screen.

Writing about rendering performance we're happy that we added some visual improvements without loosing FPS, some of these are already visible, some will be visible when we'll add some simulation improvements.

## **LA PARTE DEL NUOVO PHYSROAD CON L'USAGE (GROOVE E DISPLACEMENT)**

At the end of this blog post let we explain the reason for the price change.
For the people that support us from the day 1, nothing change.
They'll receive this new update as free update.
They were great to support us when gRally moves its first steps and give them free updates it's our way to reward them.
For the new ones we think that, with this update, we added a great feature that give you the opportunity to race against the other simdrivers extending the driven hours with gRally and we think that this add more value to this product.

**Happy second birthday gRally!!!** :champagne: :gift:
